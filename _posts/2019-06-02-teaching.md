I have teach courses in Criticism and Theory, Cultural Studies, Modern British Literature, and 20th Century American Popular Culture.

Over the past 7 years I have taught across a range of higher education settings from community college to research universities. In this time I have developed and delivered original syllabi in courses on the British novel, gender studies, intellectuals in pop culture, and English composition.
