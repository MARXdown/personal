My teaching interests are in Criticism and Theory, Cultural Studies, Modern British Literature, 20th Century American Popular Culture, and Digital Humanities.

Over the past 7 years I have taught in higher education settings across a variety of institutional contexts from community college to research universities. In this time I have developed and delivered original syllabi in courses on the British novel, gender studies, intellectuals in culture studies, and English composition.

See below for details of my teaching activities, and several sample syllabi from my courses.
