I'm Steven Gotzler a cultural studies scholar and English instructor living in Pittsburgh, PA.

Originally from California, I grew up in the Mojave desert just east of the Sierra Nevadas near Death Valley. I attended undergraduate at the University of California at Santa Cruz, where I earned a BA in American Studies with highest honors. After leaving Santa Cruz, I worked as a research assistant at the University of Pittsburgh, before going on to earn an MA in Literary and Cultural Studies in 2012. I then taught as an adjunct instructor at Robert Morris University and the Community College of Allegheny County, and in 2013 began pursuing my PhD at Carnegie Mellon University. Since achieving candidacy in 2016, I have been teaching as a graduate student instructor in the English department at Carnegie Mellon University while working to complete my dissertation.  

My research explores the intersections of intellectual culture(s), labor, and literature during the 20th century.

I am particularly interested in exploring the culture and politics of intellectual life in the U.S. and Britain during the immediate postwar period, and the history of cultural studies. In this vein, I have related interests in mid-twentieth century political economy, visual culture, and popular music. My dissertation, “The Uses of Culture: Intellectual Labor and the Sources of Cultural Studies in Britain and America, 1945-1964,” examines the emergence of radically re-oriented and theoretically expanded notions of “culture” at mid-century as they were mobilized and contested by intellectual workers in thought and fiction, art and politics.
