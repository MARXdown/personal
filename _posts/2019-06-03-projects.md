## Past and Current Projects

Add in blurb of brief framing text about the *kinds* of projects I've been involved with / done: my disseration research/book project (**The Uses of Culture** have extended dissertation abstract blurb, with image), public humanities and exhibit curation (**THE FRANKENSTEIN COMPLEX**); digital humanities and data analysis/curation (**MegaText**, Cultural Studies?); digital publishing and open access (**MARXdown**, the frankenstein variorum, the general intellect, OA the mega-game).

Include for each: (header in bold; brief blurb; side image; status and collaborators; relevant links out to current status or materials)

### The Uses of Culture: Intellectual Labor and the Sources of Cultural Studies in Britain and America, 1945-1964

My dissertation, *The Uses of Culture* examines the emergence of radically re-oriented and theoretically expanded notions of “culture” at mid-century as they were mobilized and contested  in thought and fiction, art and politics...

### MARXdown - a digital reading edition of Marx's *Capital Vol.1*

Grab text from MARXdown website, and link to live annotations here ... mention that it has been presented at CSA an ACH; flag connection to CMRG-CMU and future plans for co-ordinated reading with other groups.

### The Frankenstein Complex
Grab text from the exhibit promo materials...and perhaps re-write to emphasize more clearly the public humanities connection, and connectionto intllectuals

### The Frankenstein Variorum (*should I include this??*)
