I am interested in projects exploring topics in the history of cultural studies, 20th century culture, Marxism, and digital scholarly editing/publishing.

## Current Projects

**The Uses of Culture: Intellectual Labor and the Sources of Cultural Studies in Britain and America, 1945-1964**

My dissertation offers an alternative critical account of the emergence of cultural studies during the long fifties (1945-1964). 
Turning to sources in fiction, visual arts, and the social sciences I investigate the different social uses to which intellectuals
during this period put the idea of culture as a tool for collective action in their work as writers, artists, and academics.
Specifically, I resituate familiar figures like Richard Hoggart, Stuart Hall and Raymond Williams by mapping their uses of culture onto
the contemporaneous labors of novelists like Samuel Selvon and John Braine, and artists like Pauline Boty and the Independent Group
(IG). Drawing on current theoretical debates about the nature and future of work, my project re-describes the historical aspirations of 
cultural studies as a response to the changing conditions of intellectual labor at mid-century. Incorporating alternative sources from 
fiction and art, my account discloses a rich record of cultural experience that, when taken together, dramatize several key 
contradictions around gender, race, and empire that sit at the heart of cultural studies as it developed in the 1950s. My project also 
enlarges our sense of the origins of the field by highlighting the importance of concomitant critical movements such as the rise of 
American and Ethnic Studies in the U.S., reframing cultural studies as a largely transatlantic formation, and moving beyond its putative 
roots in the British new left.

**MARXdown** 

MARXdown is an online digital project developed for the [Contemporary Marxist Reading Group (CMRG)](https://cmrg-cmu.org/) at Carnegie Mellon University using the lightweight markup language Markdown. Designed to support group annotation of key texts for our CMRG, it provides a centralized and accessible online space for ongoing critical engagement between readers and materials related to the study of Marxist theory. This digital reading edition brings together the original English translation from 1887 Marx’s *Capital Vol. 1* with extant scholarly sources to create a multi-layered annotated edition of the text, providing critical reading guides and supplemental historical and sociological data in one easily accessible and user-friendly interface.

Collaborators: Avery J. Wiscomb, Daniel Evans. (ongoing)

**Keywords in *Cultural Studies*** 

This collaborative digital project utilizes digital tools to explore the history of the journal *Cultural Studies*. The team, including editor of Cultural Studies Ted Striphas, will be analyzing a full-text corpus of the journal’s entire output since its founding in 1987. Using textual analysis methods for large-scale modeling we will explore new ways of viewing the history of the field through its flagship journal in the U.S.

Collaborators: Ted Striphas, Natalie Suzelis, Scott Weingart, Nathan Carpenter. (ongoing)

**The Frankenstein Variorum**

This project is preparing a new digital variorum edition of the novel Frankenstein. The variorum edition is a digital collation of five distinct versions of the novel produced between 1816 and 1831. With Professor Jon Klancher, Avery J. Wiscomb, and John Quirk, I have been working as a part of the team using the hypothes.is software to generate and manage a set of linked annotations across all 5 versions of the text. 

Collaborators: Jon Klancher, Elisa E. Beshero-Bondar, Matthew Lincoln, Rikk Mulligan, John Quirk, Emma Slayton, Raffaele Viglianti, Scott B. Weingart, Avery J. Wiscomb. (ongoing)

## In Development

**The General Intellect** -- an online academic journal for research in contemporary cultural studies and critical theory with an emphasis on innovative web design and multimedia presentation. [clip from cover letter and tweak/revise]

**Marx on Fire** -- a comparative stylometry analysis of Marx’s *Capital Vol.1* and Dante’s *Inferno* examining their linkages and similarities in terms of "literary structure."
